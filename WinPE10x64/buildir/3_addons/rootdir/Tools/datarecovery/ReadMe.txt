*** 1. Introduction ***


Data Recovery Wizard is complex data recovery software developed for non-destructive data recovery from Hard Disk drives and other storage devices. It may sound complicated at first, but after reading this manual and using Data Recovery Wizard, you'll found that despite the complexity of the software, it's very easy to use. Here's a little bit about the software:

Wizard mode leads data recovery.

Step-by-step guides walk you through recovery session painlessly and easily. Intelligentized partition analysis and file research, needless complicated setting.

Data Recovery Wizard can recover folders and files that were lost because of following causes:

1. Intentional (trashed files) or unintentional deletion
2. Viruses
3. Formatting a disk
4. FDISK or any other disk-partitioning tool
5. All other non-physical data loss problems

Data Recovery Wizard can recover files and folders from disks on which the following components have become corrupted (or even if they are completely missing):

1. Partition table (main or extended)
2. Boot record (sometimes called "BIOS Parameter Block" or BPB)
3. File allocation table (both FAT1 and FAT2 on file systems that use FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32)
4. Root folder
5. Master file table

When Data Recovery Wizard recovers your data, you need have the options of saving it to another hard drive, a network drive, a floppy disk or some other type of storage device.




*** 2. System Requirements ***


Data Recovery Wizard works on all Windows-based computers. Following are detailed minimum system requirements for the Host Computer:

Operating Systems: Windows 2000, XP, 2003, Vista.
Memory (RAM): At least 128 megabytes (the more the better)
Available Space on the Good Device: Enough space to save the recovered data; for example, if you expect to recover 40 MB lost data, the Good Device should have at least 40 MB free space (and even more if you plan to take the Host Computer as the Good Device).

** 5. URGENT - Read This Before Using Data Recovery Wizard ***


Before you use Data Recovery Wizard to recover lost data, you must keep in mind a very important rule:

DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE DISK ON WHICH THE LOST DATA IS LOCATED (The Bad Device).

The success of your data recovery depends largely on your adherence to this crucial rule. When we say to make no changes to the damaged disk, we mean that you basically should leave the disk alone. This includes the following:

Do not try to delete folders or files from the Bad Device, even if you are able to see them and think that they are not damaged.

Do not try to save anything to the Bad Device.

Do not attempt to format or re-partition the Bad Device, not even with a program like fdisk or format. If the support people for these or any other applications tell you it's OK to format or re-partition the Bad Device, do not listen to them.

You will risk permanent data loss if you do not heed these warnings. If you already have made one of these mistakes, don't worry. Just don't make any more changes to the Bad Device. You can use Data Recovery Wizard free to see if your data is still recoverable. And even if Data Recovery Wizard can't detect your Bad Device, all is not lost. If your Bad Device is HDD, which is not detectable by computer's BIOS, it's URGENT for you to turn off the power of the device immediately! You will not be able to recover the device with any commercially available utilities, and you should consult a professional data recovery service provider.
